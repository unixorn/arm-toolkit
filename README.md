# arm-toolkit

Some scripts I like to have on my basement ARM cluster nodes that aren't available via `apt`. I don't particularly want to install `npm` or its ilk on my k8s nodes, but I do want to have a pleasant userspace experience.

Licenses for the scripts here can be found in their original source.

## What's in it

| Script | Original Source | Description |
| ------ | --------------- | ----------- |
| `diff-so-fancy` | [so-fancy/diff-so-fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy) | `diff-so-fancy` strives to make your diff's human readable instead of machine readable. This helps improve code quality and help you spot defects faster. |
